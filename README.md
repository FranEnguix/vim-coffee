# vim-coffee
Coffee color scheme in vim. It fits perfectly with gui mode. If you want to use term mode, your terminal needs to allow at least 16 colors.

## Colored Term (cterm)
If you are going to use a cterm, I highly recommend you remap the following colors:

Color Key | Value
--------- | --------
color0    | #9d6a47 
color1    | #6f2814 
color2    | #9ad58e 
color3    | #cbad25 
color4    | #ae81ff 
color5    | #cb6b25 
color6    | #cb8c26 
color7    | #ead49b 
color8    | #4b3516 
color9    | #e09663 
color10   | #cbb13d 
color11   | #e0af63 
color12   | #89360a 
color13   | #c15239 
color14   | #9e510d 
color15   | #e7c387
